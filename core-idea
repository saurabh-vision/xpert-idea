📌 ScanXpert – Idea & First Edition Plan
🎯 Core Idea

ScanXpert ek all-in-one PDF toolkit app hai jo users ko apne phone me documents scan, view, edit aur secure karne ki facility deta hai.

Target users:

Students (notes merge/split, highlight)

Professionals (eSign, watermark, password protect)

Normal users (combine bills, scan documents, compress PDF)

Market me existing apps ya to paid hote hain ya ads se bhare hote hain → ScanXpert ka focus hoga smooth, ad-light aur powerful PDF tools provide karna.
